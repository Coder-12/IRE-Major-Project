# Question-Generation-Summarizer
I trained the baseline like Naive Bayes to classify whether a sentence is questionable or not.Got a fairly good accuracy for the datasets which are scrapped from interview preparation site
like geeksforgeeks, N-gram Language Models from the book Speech and Language Processing and Introduction to computer system and its submodules section of NPTEL course.This model uses 
TF-IDF representation of training data.Also trained LSTM with embedding based representation of data.Used the extractive summarizer that suits current problem which in this case 
is BERT with no fine tunning.This model perform comparatively good as a baseline.
